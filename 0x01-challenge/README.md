# 0x00 Challenge

This repository contains a fixed version of the code challenge from the original [0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) repository.

## Changes Made

**[status_server/api/v1/views/index.py](status_server/api/v1/views/index.py)**

The issue with the original Python code is that it defined a Flask route decorator as `@app_views.route('/api/v1/status', methods=['GET'], strict_slashes=False)`, but it was incorrect and caused a bug.

To fix this bug, the code was modified by changing the route decorator to `@app_views.route('/status', methods=['GET'], strict_slashes=False)`. By removing the `/api/v1` prefix from the route, the bug was resolved and the endpoint is now accessible at `/status` instead of `/api/v1/status`.

This fix ensures that the Flask application correctly handles requests to the `/status` route, providing the desired functionality.

Overall, the modified code addresses the bug by adjusting the route decorator, ensuring the proper behavior of the application.

**[square.py](square.py)**

The issue with the original Python code was that there was a bug in the "area_of_my_square" method, which incorrectly calculated the area by squaring the width instead of multiplying the width and height. Additionally, the code lacked proper formatting and naming conventions. The class name "square" should have been capitalized as "Square" and the method names should have followed the standard Python naming convention.

To address these issues, the fixed code first resolves the bug in the "area_of_my_square" method by modifying it to correctly calculate the area by multiplying the width and height attributes. Then, the code is properly formatted and named. The class is now named "Square" and the method names follow the standard Python naming convention.

Overall, the fixed code now accurately calculates the square's area and is properly formatted and named, ensuring code readability and maintainability.

**[user.py](user.py)**

The issue with the original Python code is that it defines a `User` class with an `email` attribute. The `email` attribute has a setter method that checks if the provided value is a string and raises a `TypeError` if it's not. The code also has a getter method for the `email` attribute.

To fix this, the corrected code first changes the order of the getter and setter methods for the `email` attribute. In the original code, the setter method was defined before the getter method, which caused a `NameError` when trying to access the `email` attribute. By switching the order, the code now correctly sets and gets the `email` attribute.

Overall, the fixed code ensures that the `email` attribute can be properly set and retrieved in the `User` class, resolving the issues with the original code.
